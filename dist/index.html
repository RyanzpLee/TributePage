    <h3>A little about Steve Irwin</h3>
      <p> Steve Irwin inherited a love of large reptiles early on in life and shared his love and passion through his work at the Australia Zoo and his popular TV series <em>The Crocodile Hunter</em>. He was also nicknamed "The Crocodile Hunter" and grew up taking care and studying animals on his parent's wildlife park, and became a well-known figure in popular culture with his trademark khaki shirt and shorts.</p>

        <p>Steve Irwin was a loving father and husband who dedicated his life to protecting wildlife and wild places. He accomplished this life mission through his wildlife documentary series The Crocodile Hunter, his world famous Australia Zoo, and his charity <a href="https://wildlifewarriors.org.au/">Wildlife Warriors</a>. He was best known for his rescue and research work with endangered saltwater crocodiles, the closest living relative of the dinosaurs, now the largest reptiles on earth. Today we continue his mission by working to overturn recent legislation in Queensland which allows crocodile egg harvesting from vulnerable crocs in the wild to support the commercial leather trade. Steveâ€™s legacy will definitely live on.
